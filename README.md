Notes:
Project created with MCreator but every piece of code is locked and rewritten.
The tool is used mainly to accelerate development.

I fiddle with this project to learn about modding and because I thought there was not many mods fulfilling this niche.


Description:
Welcome to the new Cavier Caves! This 1.19.3 mod is designed to give more life to the already rich underground of the world of Minecraft.
Discover new and unique biomes, go on a quest for new blocks that will help you on your creative journey.
Designed with a vanilla plus mindset, this addon will feel natural and won't disrupt the balance of the game.
