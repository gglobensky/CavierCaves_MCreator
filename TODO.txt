Bugfixes:
Correct bug where crystals generate on crystals
muhsrooms get inside shown if water is next to it
shrooms that increase by increments of 2 can have a floating block if second last block is a corner ignored and last is not ignored
thick trunks are still misaligned sometimes (sometimes odd numbered but why tho?)
Dull MoonStone Walls dont connect to each other
Make sure shrooms dont show through dirt


Features:
Add fallen selenite crystals?
Add Chromastone - Stone that turns bright when in contact with fungus
	maybe it could change color when in contact with fungus and while in contact allow color cycle in some way, 
	maybe right click with another mushroom block
Add Biome Diamond Depths with
	Brittle basalt - cracks before falling. 
	Rhyolite - red rock
	More diamonds than usual
	Lots of lava
	Magma cubes?
2 Resources spread apart that need to be mixed
Create mod lamps with crystals? More power for more brightness?
Add Biome Fossil Forest with
	Petrified trees
	lakes
	ancient ruins?
	rivers?
	small ghost fungus and purple one
	waterfalls?

A biome that would fit well in tight spaces
Make ghost fungus bonemealable

Biome with multicolored streaks of marble


Cracks with magma blocks, lava and maybe geysers

Spectral Water: This is a special type of water that glows in the dark. It can be found in underground lakes and pools throughout the biome. Players can use it to create unique lighting effects or as a source of renewable glowstone.

Mushroom Spores: These are floating particles that can be found in the air throughout the biome. They can be collected with a special tool (e.g. a spore collector) and used to grow giant mushrooms outside of the Spectral Caverns biome.
